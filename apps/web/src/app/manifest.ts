/**
 * Web App Manifest — makes the site installable (Add to Home Screen) as a
 * standalone app with the church logo. Next serves this at
 * /manifest.webmanifest and injects the <link rel="manifest"> automatically.
 *
 * The manifest is static, so it uses the app's default language (English)
 * regardless of the language an individual account has chosen — and, for the
 * same reason, the church name below is a build-time literal rather than the
 * `church` record every screen inside the app reads from: a manifest is
 * generated once at build time, with no request and no database. It is the
 * one place (with the <title> in app/layout.tsx) where the church is still
 * baked in per deployment.
