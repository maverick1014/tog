# TOG（主恩堂）Codebase Guide & Golden Rules

Church-management app. Next.js 15 (App Router, React 19) + Supabase, deployed to
Cloudflare Workers via OpenNext. The UI ships in three languages (English /
简体中文 / Bahasa Melayu, chosen per login account, English by default); light
theme only; mobile-first. The API is a single catch-all route handler at
`apps/web/src/app/api/[...path]/route.ts`; auth is a signed HMAC cookie
(`lib/server/auth.ts`).

The church itself is **data**, not a hardcoded string: one `church` row
(name / short name / description / logo) drives the sidebar brand, the login
card and the public forms, and `church_modules` records which **add-on
modules** this church runs. Both are edited on `/church` (教会设置,
super_admin only). The catalog of what is switchable lives in code —
`OPTIONAL_MODULES` in `packages/shared` — where each entry names its key, the
nav href it owns and the API prefixes it owns; today the one entry is
`discipleship` (四十天守望). Core surfaces are not switchable and are not in
the registry.

**培训 became 培训&活动 (Trainings & Activities).** Everything that is neither a
Sunday nor a hand-added meeting lives on `/trainings` now — a brothers' hike, a
sisters' baking afternoon — because an activity is exactly what sign-ups plus a
roll call already are. One column tells the two shapes apart: `trainings.kind`
(`course` | `activity`, migration 0014). A **course** runs over several
sessions; an **activity** is ONE occasion, whose single `training_sessions` row
is created by the API with it and exists only to give the roll call its one
column to tick — its date is the record's own `starts_on`/`ends_on` (the same
day twice), so there is no second place a date can be edited. The public
self-sign-up link (`/enroll/[id]`, matching a full name) serves both.

**Attendance is two different shapes, on purpose.** A Sunday is not an event:
every Sunday simply happens, so `/events` (崇拜与祷告会) opens on a **sheet** —
`sunday_attendance`, one row per (堂会, Sunday, member) carrying the two ticks
a Sunday has, 会前 and 主日 (migration 0013). Its columns come from the
calendar, so nothing creates a Sunday and a Sunday nobody marked has no rows at
all. **A sheet is always one congregation** — each hall rolls its own call even
on a joint week, so there is no 联合聚会 concept left and an all-congregations
read is a 400, never a merge. The `events` table is now only for the meetings
someone genuinely adds by hand (an occasional Wednesday prayer meeting: a name,
a date, a hall), which keep the old 出席/请假/缺席 roll call. Nothing
manufactures a 主日崇拜 row any more — 循环聚会 still tops the calendar up for
weeknight rules and skips Sunday ones. A **life group's** roll-call card
(`/groups/[id]`) switches between the three with a segmented control, default
小组: 小组 is its own meetings, while 会前 and 主日 are that group's members read
off **their congregation's** Sunday sheet — the same rows and the same
`PUT /api/attendance/sundays` the services page writes, so a tick in either
place is one fact ("只要有主日那就有会前" therefore needs no extra storage). A
group belongs to one hall, so those tabs name that hall rather than following
the congregation switcher.

Run before every push: `npm run --workspace @tog/web -s build` (or in
`apps/web`: `npx tsc --noEmit && npm test && npm run build`). Deploys are gated
on unit tests + a post-deploy smoke test (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`).

Testing layers (in `apps/web`):
- `npm test` — Vitest unit tests (labels, rules, perms, i18n dictionaries).
- `npm run test:api-e2e` — API end-to-end against the live Worker (auth, role
  matrix, full CRUD, public form).
- `npm run test:ui-e2e` — **browser UI end-to-end**: drives the real site in
  Chromium and asserts each interaction's expected outcome (login, search,
  filters, modals, weekly attendance, a 主日点名 tick→untick round-trip,
  discipleship day-notes, the life-group card's 小组/会前/主日 tabs writing the
  congregation's Sunday sheet, a 培训&活动 course/activity filter plus an
  activity's single-column roll call, an interface-language round-trip, a
  守望模块 create→edit→delete cycle, an add-on module off→on cycle on 教会设置,
  a create→delete member write-cycle).
  It restores anything it changes — including the module states, which it
  reads first and puts back in a `finally`. It runs a tiny in-process reverse proxy so the browser
  works even behind an egress proxy. `UI_E2E_PASSWORD` is required (never
  hardcode a real password); `UI_E2E_URL` / `UI_E2E_EMAIL` are optional. In this
  sandbox run it as:
  `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1 PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_PATH=/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-1194/chrome-linux/chrome UI_E2E_PASSWORD=… npm run test:ui-e2e`.
  When you add/rename a page or a key interaction, add a matching check to
  `scripts/ui-e2e.mjs`.
  **This script is only valid against the build it was checked out from.** The
  site has one shared URL, and `deploy.yml` only ever runs on feature branches,
  so an old script pointed at a newer deploy reports moved selectors as
  "failures". CI therefore pins the checkout to the deployed SHA
  (`ref: github.event.workflow_run.head_sha`) and passes
  `UI_E2E_EXPECT_BUILD`; the script waits for `/api/version` to report that
  build and **skips with exit 0** if a newer deploy overtook it. Never "fix" a
  red automatic run by loosening a selector before checking which build it
  actually tested.
- `npm run ui:shots` — **screenshot sweep**: captures every list page at a phone
  and a desktop viewport into `$OUT` (default `/tmp/shots`; `WIDE=1` for
  desktop). ui-e2e proves the pages *work*; it cannot see that two pages lay
  their header out differently. After any layout change, run this and **look at
  the images** — a green ui-e2e is not evidence the UI is consistent.
  The `ui-e2e` workflow runs the `WIDE=1` sweep itself and uploads it under
  `desktop/` in the same artifact, because ui-e2e drives a 402px phone and so
  never photographs anything inside `.only-desktop` — which is every list
  table, and therefore most column work.

## GOLDEN RULES — every auditor / code reviewer MUST check these

These are hard requirements for this codebase. A change that breaks one is a
review finding, not a preference. Cite the rule number in the finding.

### G1 — CRUD completeness on every management page
Every entity page (成员、小组、额外聚会、培训&活动（课程与活动两种形态）、四十天守望模块与配对、账户) must offer
the full set its users need: **Create, Read, Update, Delete**. If the API supports an
operation, the UI must expose it (or the omission must be a deliberate,
documented decision). A page that can only create + list is incomplete.
The documented exception: 教会设置 (`/church`) is read + update only — the
church row is a seeded singleton (one deployment, one church) and the module
catalog is code, so neither can be created or deleted from the UI.

### G2 — Access control is enforced server-side AND reflected in the UI
Three independent dimensions, all of them enforced in `route.ts` first and
only then reflected in the UI: the account's **role**, its **hall**, and
whether the **module** owning the path is enabled for this church.
- **Module enablement (附加模块):** an add-on module (四十天守望 today) can be
  switched off in 教会设置. A request for a path a disabled module owns is
  refused **404** by the gate — including the public mentor form, whose links
  must close with the feature. 404 rather than 403 on purpose: no role and no
  hall can reach it, because for this church the feature does not exist.
  Which paths a module owns comes from `moduleForApiPath` / `moduleForNavHref`
  in `packages/shared` — never re-derive it. The UI's half: the shell hides the
  nav entry (`visibleItems`), a page owned by a disabled module skips its
  fetches and renders `<ModuleDisabled />` instead of an error, and
  `/church*` + `/auth*` + every core path can never be gated.
- **Hall scope (多堂会):** the session carries `hall` (null = 全堂权限). In
  `route.ts`, a hall-scoped account's reads are filtered to its own hall and its
  writes are **forced** onto that hall server-side — never trust a client-sent
  `hall_id`. Nullable-hall entities (培训 / 聚会) additionally expose their
  全堂开放 (`hall_id is null`) rows to every hall. `members`/`groups` always
  carry a hall. A pair (守望配对) has no hall column — its hall is its
  **mentor's** hall (`discipleship_pair_summary.hall_id`).
  New hall-scoped queries must go through the same gate helpers rather than
  re-rolling the check: `hallFilter` (which hall a **list** read is narrowed
  to), `withHall` / `assertHallWritable` / `assertOwnsRow` (writes), and
  `assertRowReadable` / `assertPairInHall` (id-addressed detail reads).
- **Congregation switcher:** a 全堂权限 account narrows its view with the
  switcher, which appends `?hall_id=` to every request (`withHallParam`).
  `hallFilter = hallScope ?? q.get('hall_id')` — the **session's own hall always
  wins**, so a hall-pinned account can never widen its view by sending a
  different `hall_id`; that precedence is the security property. Every
  hall-owned list GET (成员/小组/聚会/循环聚会/培训/守望配对/主日点名 + 牧养总览)
  reads `hallFilter`, so switching congregation moves the whole app — dashboard
  KPIs included — not just some pages.
  **主日点名 is the one read that refuses to answer "all congregations"**: a
  sheet is always exactly one hall, so with no narrowing (and more than one
  hall) it is a 400 rather than three member lists merged into one grid.
- **Server (authoritative):** every non-public API path goes through the gate in
  `route.ts`. Writes are denied for `readonly`; account management
  (`/accounts*`, both **read and write**) is `super_admin` only; church
  settings (`/church*`) are readable by any signed-in account but **writable
  only by `super_admin`** — changing the church's name or switching a module
  off affects everyone; `DELETE` is `super_admin`/`admin` only. Sensitive reads
  (account emails/roles) must be role-gated too — never rely on "GET is
  harmless".
- **Client (UX):** never render an action a user's role cannot perform. Fetch the
  session role (`/api/auth/me`) and hide/disable nav items, buttons, and whole
  pages the role isn't allowed to use. A button that only ever returns 403 is a
  bug. The public exceptions (no session) are the mentor daily form under
  `/api/discipleship/form/*`, the training self-enrollment form under
  `/api/trainings/enroll/*`, **`GET /api/church`** (the login card and both
  public forms render the church's name before anyone signs in; writes stay
  super_admin) (+ `/api/auth/*`) — each a narrow, specific handler.

### G3 — Every destructive action shows a confirmation
Any delete/remove/detach/irreversible action (`api.delete(...)`, or a mutation
like 移除/清空/重置 that discards data) MUST go through the shared
`useConfirm()` dialog (`components/ui.tsx`) with `danger: true`. Native
`window.confirm` is not allowed. No silent destructive taps.

### G4 — One mechanism, not per-page reimplementations (altitude)
Reuse the shared primitives instead of re-rolling them per page:
`Modal`, `Field`, `PasswordInput`, `useConfirm`, `useToast`, `RoleBadge`,
`Avatar`, `PairProgressModal`, `MonthPicker`/`SheetTick` (the pieces the 主日
and 小组 attendance sheets share), `Segmented` (every segmented control — the
group card's 小组/会前/主日 tabs and the 出席/请假/缺席 picker),
`exportRows`/`exportMatrix` (`lib/export.ts`),
`api` (`lib/api.ts`), and the label/style helpers in `lib/labels.ts`
(`roleTagStyle`, `roleDot`, `memberRoleZh`, `positionZh`, status/category
classes). New code that duplicates one of these is a finding — name the helper
to call instead. Colours come from CSS tokens / `ROLE_TAG`, never hard-coded hex
in components.

### G5 — Data fetch/derive once; simplify state
Don't map the same collection twice (e.g. desktop table + mobile tiles) with the
logic duplicated — compute the row model once and feed both, or use one
presentational component. Don't keep state you can derive from props/fetch.
Prefer `useFetch` + `useMemo` over manual effect/loading bookkeeping.

### G6 — Performance & correctness hygiene
- Lazy-load heavy libs on use (SheetJS for exports already does this); never add
  them to the initial bundle or to module top-level.
- API route handlers stay dynamic (`export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`) so
  the auth gate always runs and GET responses are never statically cached.
- No blocking work in render; run independent awaits together.
- Guard every list access and optional join (`x?.y ?? fallback`); Supabase
  embedded selects can be null.
- Passwords: PBKDF2 hash server-side only, min 8 chars, never stored/logged in
  plaintext; password fields use `PasswordInput` (show/hide) with the right
  `autoComplete`.

### G7a — One page-chrome shape for every page
The header is **title only** (no subtitles). Every list page's top row is one
shared `<PageBar filters actions />`: the page's filters on the left, **all of
its buttons in the right corner**, collapsing to a stacked filters-then-actions
column below 640px. A page never renders a second bar, never puts a `<select>`
in the actions half, and never gives an action an ad-hoc width — page actions
are content-sized like every other control. Filter order inside the bar is
search → dropdowns → export/info.

Shell-level controls (the congregation switcher) belong to the shell, not to a
page: top right of the header on desktop, in the nav drawer above 首页 on
phones. They use the same `--control-h` as every other control — no `sm`
variant, no inline width.
List tables size their columns to their own content (`table-layout: auto` +
`white-space: nowrap` on cells). Never hand-type a column width: one tuned to
two CJK glyphs clips the moment the same label is English.

### G6a — Every date and time is Malaysia time
The church is in one place, so a 10:00 service reads 10:00 on every screen.
All date/time work goes through `lib/time.ts` (`churchParts`,
`churchInstant`, `startOfChurchDay`, `addChurchDays`, `churchDayOfWeek`,
`churchDateKey`, `toChurchInput` / `fromChurchInput`, `endOfChurchDate`,
and the calendar-label helpers `weekdayDatesOfMonth` / `sundaysOfMonth` /
`isSundayDate` that both attendance sheets take their columns from).
Never call `getHours` / `setHours` / `getFullYear` / `getMonth` / `getDate` /
`getTimezoneOffset` on a `Date` in app code — they read the *runtime's* zone,
which is UTC inside the Worker and the viewer's own zone in the browser, so
the same row rendered two different times. A `datetime-local` value is a bare
wall-clock reading and always means Malaysia. A stored `DATE` covers its whole
Malaysian day — compare against `endOfChurchDate`, not `new Date(dateOnly)`,
or it expires at 08:00 that morning. Unit tests must pass under a non-Malaysia
`TZ` (`TZ=America/New_York npm test`).

### G7 — Mobile-first & theme
Tables become list tiles on small screens (`.only-desktop` / `.only-mobile`
helpers). Two-column layouts collapse to a single full-width column on tablet
and below. Light theme only — no dark-mode branches or `data-theme` code.

### G8 — Every user-facing string comes from the dictionary
- No literal user-facing text in a component — ever. Render it with
  `useT()` from `lib/i18n` and a key that exists in **all three** dictionaries
  (`lib/i18n/en.ts` is the base and the fallback; `zh.ts` / `ms.ts` are typed
  against its key set, and `lib/__tests__/i18n.test.ts` fails the build on a
  missing key, a blank translation, or a drifted `{placeholder}`).
- Enum labels (roles, statuses, weekdays, categories…) live in the dictionary
  too. `lib/labels.ts` returns **message keys**, never text; call sites do
  `t(memberStatusKey(s))`. A label map that returns a translated string is a
  finding.
- Never key data structures — colour palettes, filter values, sort orders — by
  a translated label. Use the stored code (e.g. `DisplayRole`), or the UI breaks
  the moment the language changes.
- The public pages (`/login`, `/d/[token]`, `/enroll/[id]`) have no session and
  so render in the default language; API error messages are English. The
  church's **name** is the one thing on them that is neither: it is data on the
  `church` record, identical in all three languages, so those pages fetch the
  public `GET /api/church` instead of translating it (`form.privacy` takes it
  as a `{church}` placeholder). The build-time `<title>` (`app/layout.tsx`) and
  the PWA manifest (`app/manifest.ts`) cannot read the database and stay
  per-deployment literals — the only two left.
- A user-facing rename stops at the API boundary. The 四十天守望 **模块 /
  module** is `discipleship_programs` in the database: the table, its columns,
  `program_id` and `/api/discipleship/programs` all keep the "program" name,
  while every dictionary key (`disc.module.*`) and everything on screen says
  module. Renaming the wire too would be a migration's worth of churn for
  nothing visible — but the boundary must stay in one place (the page's fetch),
  not smeared through the file.
- Match surrounding code: functional components, hooks at top, shared `ui.tsx`
  building blocks, no new CSS frameworks.
- Keep `docs/` and this file in sync when a rule or flow changes.

### G9 — Form controls share one size system
- Every single-line control — `input`, `select`, and `.btn` — is sized by the
  shared `--control-h` (small variants by `--control-h-sm`), never by ad-hoc
  per-element padding/height. A `<select>` placed next to a `<button>` (e.g. the
  member-picker + add-member row) must line up in height; a control that doesn't
  use the token is a finding. Don't set custom `height`/vertical `padding` on a
  control to "fix" alignment — fix the token or the class.
- `<select>` uses `appearance: none` with the shared custom chevron (drawn via
  `background-image`, right-aligned padding). Never rely on the native arrow —
  its metrics differ per browser/device and break both height and alignment.
- Date/time inputs (`date` / `time` / `datetime-local` / `month` / `week`) strip
  WebKit's native box the same way — `appearance: none` plus a `min-height` on
  the token, and `::-webkit-date-and-time-value` reset to left-aligned with no
  UA margin. Without it iOS/iPadOS sizes the field from the system picker and
  paints the value centred, so it sits taller than the `<select>` beside it and
  reads centre while its neighbours read left. It lives in `globals.css` with
  the other shared control rules — never patch one page's date field.
- New controls inherit these by using the base element / `.btn` classes; page
  code should not restyle control geometry inline.

## Reviewer output
Report findings most-severe first. Correctness/security (G2, G3, G6) outrank
CRUD gaps (G1) which outrank cleanup/altitude (G4, G5, G8, G9). Every finding
cites a concrete failure scenario and, where applicable, the golden-rule number.
